Exploring open ended learning

Also take a look at [this](https://github.com/ShengranHu/ADAS) project

1. Core Structure:

- `Idea` dataclass to represent generated text and its fitness score
- `CreativeExplorer` class that handles the generation and evolution process
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns

2. Key Components:

- LLM Integration: Uses OpenAI's API for text generation
- Genetic Algorithm concepts: Population, mutation, selection
- Fitness evaluation: Customizable fitness function
- Simple exploration loop combining these elements

3. Iterative Development Roadmap:
Phase 1 (Current Implementation):

- Basic text generation with LLM
- Simple genetic algorithm structure
- Basic fitness function

Phase 2 (Next Steps):

- Add crossover operations between ideas
- Implement more sophisticated fitness functions
- Add memory/history tracking

Phase 3 (Advanced Features):

- Implement MCTS for exploring idea trees
- Add multi-objective optimization
- Implement clustering for diversity

Possible Extensions:

- Add prompt templates for better control
- Implement different mutation strategies
- Add reinforcement learning for fitness function tuning
- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Add visualization of the exploration tree
